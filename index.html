                    <p>Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
